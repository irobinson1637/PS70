        For my CNC project, I wanted to make some custom coasters or settles of Catan tiles. I started by creating a simple design in Fusion360. The eventual idea was to use the CNC to carve actual relief/quarries/mountains/ridges into the tiles. I tried at first to do this
        using a website, https://touchterrain.geol.iastate.edu/main, but it proved difficult to get the desired results. I then tried to use Fusion360 software to create the desired relief alongside a tutorial and Terrain2STL. However, I 
        couldn't really get anything to work particulalry well and also realized that the CNC would not be able to carve the relief as deeply as I wanted in order
        to attain the desire 3D effect but still have the coaster be flat enough to work as a coaster. I then decided to just
        put a nice font like the online catan font on the tiles. Using the CNC, I cut the design out of wood. I chose the wood because it's easy to work with. I then considered foam board/pink foam but it does not seem to machine as well.  Once the design was cut out, I tried sanding down the edges to make them smooth and even.

For my molding and casting project, I first wanted to make resin chess pieces. I thought makeing them out of clear colored expoxy could produce a really clean look.
I started by 3D printing a positive. The idea was to use some solvent to then make the pieces really smooth, use that to make a silicone negative, and then use that to cast a whole
set in clear resin. I also thought as a next steo it would be cool to put LEDs in them so that they light up. However,
my 3D print of the chess pieces failed twice after about an hour and I ran out of time, so I had to pivot. I think it was because
I was printing a Knight without support, and the overhang from the face was too much.

Thus I pivoted to instead make CS50 ducks. I made a mold in expoxy by gluing the duck to the lid of a containeer and filling the container up to make a negative.
Unfortunately there was no oomu left so I had to use resin for the mold, and the mixing was a bit difficult as it was by weight and not by volume alongside
all the scales were broken. I think it turned out well thought and will be casting some ducks in wax to usurp David Malan's duck monopoly!

Overall, I had a great time working on these projects. CNC and molding/casting are both really cool techniques that offer a lot of creative possibilities. I'm excited to keep experimenting with these tools and seeing what else I can make!

Note: I didn't end up being able to complete all of these due to my senior thesis deadline of Friday at 4PM. I will be working on them over the weekend and will update this page with the final results.
