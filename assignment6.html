        For my CNC project, I wanted designed and made a set of custom coasters or settles of Catan tiles. I started by creating a simple design in Fusion360. The eventual idea was to use the CNC to carve actual relief/quarries/mountains/ridges into the tiles, but for starters I started with simple hexagons. 

Using the CNC, I cut the design out of wax. I chose the wax because it's easy to work with. Originally I wanted to make it out of wood, but it proved difficult to find sizeable pieces.
I then considered foam board/pink foam but it does not seem to machine as well.  Once the design was cut out, I tried sanding down the edges to make them smooth and even.

For my molding and casting project, I wanted to make a set of decorative resin paperweights, that would be in the form of the houses and cities from catan. I started by creating a mold out of silicone using a CNCed wax figure. Once the mold was complete, I mixed up a batch of clear casting resin and poured it into the mold.

After letting the resin cure for a few hours, I removed the paperweights from the mold. They looked AMAZING, but were a few bubbles. Ideally, I would have used a vacuum chanber to remove said bubbles beforehand. This would create a smooth, bubble-free surface that looked fantastic.

Overall, I had a great time working on these projects. CNC and molding/casting are both really cool techniques that offer a lot of creative possibilities. I'm excited to keep experimenting with these tools and seeing what else I can make!

Note: I didn't end up being able to complete all of these due to my senior thesis deadline of Friday at 4PM. I will be working on them over the weekend and will update this page with the final results.
