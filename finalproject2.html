      <p>A top is a spinning toy that consists of a spinning body, usually a disk or a cone, with a pointed tip that is spun on its axis using a string or a wand. The goal of this project is to build a top that can spin indefinitely without stopping. This can be achieved by using a combination of mechanical and electrical components, such as a motor, a battery, and a control system. The top will be designed to be portable and easy to use, making it a fun and educational toy for children and adults alike.</p>
      <h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>To design and build a top that can spin indefinitely.</li>
      <li>To use a combination of mechanical and electrical components to create a stable spinning motion.</li>
      <li>To design a portable and user-friendly top that can be used by people of all ages.</li>
      <li>To incorporate educational elements into the design of the top, such as the principles of physics and engineering.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>The project will be approached in several stages, including the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Research and design phase: This will involve researching existing spinning tops and exploring different designs and materials that can be used to build a top that can spin indefinitely.</li>
      <li>Prototyping phase: This will involve building a series of prototypes to test different designs and components to see which ones work best.</li>
      <li>Testing and refining phase: This will involve testing the prototypes and refining the design based on the results of the tests.</li>
      <li>Final build phase: This will involve building the final top, incorporating all of the best elements from the prototypes and refining the design as necessary to create a top that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
      </ul>
