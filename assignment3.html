            I decided to try and make a robotic arm for this week's project. The idea was originally to have a servo at the base that allowd for rotation and then a smaller servo mounted
            to serve as a joint and then maybe a claw at the top. I figured this would be a pretty cool project to 
            demonstrate the input-output abilities of the arduino. I started by wiring up the servos and potentiometers in accordance with this scehmatic:
            <img src="schematic.png" class="w-60 img-fluid" alt="Italian Trulli">
            I tested it all out and everything seemed to be working ok. I then went on to build the actual arm itself, which I did out of cardboard. At first
            I was trying to think of a way to use a system of strights or wiring or hydrolics to move the arm, as I was worried about actually mounting a servo in the arm making
            the arm too heavy. I couldnt quite figure it out so I decided just to use a little servo for the upper motor in order to keep it light. I mounted the servo
            into the cardboard just using pressure fit and then attached the arms to the little plastic bits that come with the servos and using a screw for the 
            other side of the arm mount. Here is the code I used:

                #include <Servo.h>
                
                //Servo Objects

                Servo Servo_1;

                  Servo_2.write(0);
                
                }

                {
                
                  Pot_0 = analogRead(A0);               // Read input from pot and store it in the Variable Pot_0.
                  Servo_0_Pos = map(Pot_0, 0, 1023, 1, 90); //Map servos as per the value between 0 to 1023
                  Pot_1 = analogRead(A1);

                  Servo_1.write(Servo_1_Pos);   
                  delay(10);

        <p>
            When it came to putting everything together things just stopped working. At first, the arm would work but shut off after
            a second or two. I think running both servos off the arduino power supply was too much and so 
            the board was shutting off because it couldn't supply that much current. I tried using an external 5V power
            supply but then the servos were behaving super eratically and not responding to the pots at all. After a few hours
            I found out I somehow fried the board power supply as the arduino 5V was not providing 5V according to the multimeter. I ended up getting it 
            kind of working.

            I think I did a few things wrong. First, I know nothing about electronics and we didnt cover it too much in class. I think
            maybe what happened is that the breadboards aren't rated for such high amps and so that got fried along with the board
            leading to some difficult debugging. I also think that maybe all of the grounds needed to be connected together, and that
            I should connect in the future the servos directly to power instead of through the breadboard.
